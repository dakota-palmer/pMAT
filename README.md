## What is pMAT?

Fiber Photometry is a tool for neural imaging of calcium or neurotransmitter dynamics.  Many commercial systems exist for recording data, but analysis software is lacking across the field. 
Here we've introduced an open-source analysis package that can be used widely to standardize analysis approaches.
