## What is pMAT?

Fiber Photometry is a tool for neural imaging of calcium or neurotransmitter dynamics.  Many commercial systems exist for recording data, but analysis software is lacking across the field. 
Here we've introduced an open-source analysis package that can be used widely to standardize analysis approaches.

## Sample Data 🧪💾
Below are links to sample data files from either Tucker Davis Technologies (TDT) or a generic comma-separated value ('.CSV') format.
These files provide examples of how files should be formatted for use in pMAT and can also be used when learning to process data in pMAT.
